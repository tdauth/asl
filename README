This is a huge collection of JASS and vJass scripts which is called "Advanced Script Library" or just "ASL".
It contains some useful systems which can be used for creating custom Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne projects.

Additionally, there is a bug tracker which can be used, as well:

I've moved the scripts into extern code files since I'm working on a GNU/Linux system and the trigger
editor is very bugged if you use it with wine.
Besides some files can be excluded easily by unsetting various global constants which are listed below which decreases the code's size massively.

Installation/Usage:

-- JassHelper:
JassHelper 0.A.2.A is required since there is an unknown bug in higher version (0.A.2.B) which prevents
code from being compiled correctly.
Options [forcemethodevaluate] and [noimplicitthis] are supported!

-- Code integration:
Use file "src/Import Asl.j" to import all required scripts.
Usually you have to change the lookup folder entry in the "jasshelper.conf" file of your JassHelper
program before.
The JassHelper has to lookup folder "src" in this directory. If configured correctly you're able to
write a simple statement like //! import "Import Asl.j" into your own code or map script.

The following list shows you which global constants have to be specified in your custom code that ASL works properly:
globals
	constant boolean A_RTC = false
	constant boolean A_JAPI = false
	constant boolean A_SYSTEMS = true
	constant boolean A_DEBUG_HANDLES = false // not usable yet!
	constant boolean A_DEBUG_NATIVES = false
	constant boolean A_NET = false // not usable yet!
	constant boolean A_FPS_MOVEMENT = false // not usable yet!
	constant real A_MAX_COLLISION_SIZE = 500.0 // used by function GetUnitCollisionSize
	constant integer A_MAX_COLLISION_SIZE_ITERATIONS = 10 // used by function GetUnitCollisionSize
	constant integer A_SPELL_RESISTANCE_CREEP_LEVEL = 6 // used by function IsUnitSpellResistant
	// used by function GetTimeString()
	constant string A_TEXT_TIME_VALUE = tr("0%1%")
	constant string A_TEXT_TIME_PAIR = GetLocalizedString("%1%:%2%")
	// used by ATalk
	constant string A_TEXT_EXIT = GetLocalizedString("Exit")
	constant string A_TEXT_BACK = GetLocalizedString("Back")
	constant string A_TEXT_TARGET_TALKS_ALREADY = GetLocalizedString("Target is already talking.")
	// used by ADialog
	constant string A_TEXT_DIALOG_BUTTON = GetLocalizedString("[%1%] %2%")
endglobals

If you're using debug mode and ASL's debug utilities (ASystemsDebug) you'll have to defined lots of cheat strings.
For default English strings you can import a pre-defined file using:
//! import "Systems/Debug/Text en.j"

WARNING: Apparently, GetLocalizedString() in constant strings crashes the game in map selection!

-- Trigger editor integration:
Import the following files with their corresponding paths to enable various data types and functions in World Editor's trigger editor:

"gui/UI/TriggerData.txt"
Import path:
"UI\TriggerData.txt"

"gui_<language id>/UI/TriggerStrings.txt"
Import path:
"UI\TriggerStrings.txt"

gui_<language id>/UI/WorldEditStrings.txt"
Import path:
"UI\WorldEditStrings.txt"

Remember that you have to import all ASL code into your map (script) to use those trigger actions and types.
Currently supported language ids are:
* de

-- Parser/pjass bug:
If you're using a huge amount of code (like me) I recommend dropping "pjass" usage and replacing it
by JassParser (http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=105235) since there is a memory exhausted bug in
"pjass" (http://www.wc3c.net/showpost.php?p=1115263&postcount=154).

-- jAPI and RtC support:
ASL supports "japi" (http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=79652) and "RtC" (http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=109255). Just set global constants A_JAPI or A_RTC to value true.
If you set global constant A_FPS_MOVEMENT to value true (which needs A_RTC set to be true, as well) the character movement system
should be usable by mouse keys.

-- BonusMod support:
For using Bonus Mod you have to make an entry in the "jasshelper.conf" file for the object merger tool.
It should always be named "ObjectMerger".
You have to import file "Systems/BonusMod/Creation Bonus Mod.j" once to create all object editor data required by Bonus Mod code.

-- Optimization:
Please use Wc3mapoptimizer (http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=79326) to decrease your map script size and increase the script's performance.
