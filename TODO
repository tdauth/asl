2011-11-24 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* 1.3 preparings:
* Character/world systems: Replace all init() methods by dynamic members!
* There is lots of erase() calls for AVector instances which might perform really really bad. Use AList instead! But only for the cases where really often something is erased.
* AHashTable with StringHash() functions is not necessarily safe. StringHash() might collide with another hash. Besides it is very slow. Remove methods with StringHash(). Replace everything by integer keys.
* FIXED: AInventory: When a spell is stopped (ASpell) from an item the item charges are set to 0 (no stacked item).
* FIXED: AInventory: When a character gives the page item to another it will be reset but remain in the rucksack of the other as normal item as well!
* AInventory: More public methods: showRucksackPage(integer pageNumber)
* AInventory: 0 timer functions might fail when the character dies at that moment. When he is dead the items might land on the ground.
* FIXED: AInventory: Allow giving owned item to another character. Detect giving order!
* FIXED: AInventory: Allow picking up items with full inventory page: http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/spells-569/easy-item-stack-n-split-v2-7-4-a-153287/?prev=search%3Dstack%26d%3Dlist%26r%3D20
* FIXED: AInventory: When adding item fails the AInventoryItemData should not be set. It duplicates the items!
* DONE: ALayer: Remove since deprecated and not used.
* AJump: Remove init() and disable timer if no AJump instance exists.
* DONE: ATalk should work with multiple characters at the same time. Required feature from "Die Macht des Feuers". It is very annoying to use a talk for only one player at once.
* Test CreateTrackableForPlayer() (sync?, crash?)!
* Improve merge() of A_VECTOR.
* Fix A_MAP.
* Fix ARoutine when setting the time of day manually. For example AVideo stores the time and then calls SetTimeOfDay() to restore it. Appearently, the routines are not called properly in those cases. When setting the time from 12 to 4 and the NPC should THEN sleep, he tries to enter the house but just stands there and is still visible. The problem is that "end()" is called in "start" is called in different orders.
* String misc unit test has still 2 errors and comments!
* Implement AVolumeSet.setDefaultVolume()
* Test EndCinematicSceneForPlayer() for desync!
* Finish Character systems: APvp
* DONE: Drop character systems: AFight, AFocus, AMovement (never been used, never worked)
* No more @ comments, group parts, add \ref etc etc to get propper Doxygen comments.
* Change tests for containers, strings and time of day functions to unit tests:
	* multiboard bar could get Unit Test too with dynamic refreshment
* FIXED: AVideo: Add player leaves trigger which then checks m_skippingPlayers and skips the video if it is greater than the number of remaining players!!!
* AVideo: Should be based on force, not one global video!
* ASpell and AUnitSpell: Use one base struct or module since it is the same functionaility.
* FIXED: AClassSelection: Remove static members, make more members dynamic, add event handler methods, make it more flexible, handle player leaves who still has to select a class and for whom the class is not selected automatically since it is destroyed completely.
* DONE: AClassSelection: Completely remove static initialization parameters (make them dynamic).
* ACharacter: Remove displayMessage() and convenience stuff.
* ASpawnPoint: Allow multiple item pools per member similar to creep spots in strategy game.
* ASpawnPoint: Add API docs.
* ASpawnPoint: make it widget based that destructables are also usable.
* ASpawnPoint: Use events: call TriggerRegisterUnitEvent( t, u, EVENT_UNIT_DEATH ) and call TriggerRegisterUnitEvent( t, u, EVENT_UNIT_CHANGE_OWNER )
* FIXED: AQuestItem: Create quest item in the beginning and make it invisble if it is not used to keep the correct order of items.
* FIXED: AInventory: Disable must remove permanent abilities from the character's unit.
* FIXED: ShowUnitForPlayer() desync: http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?p=1100333 (keine shared vision und ghost-Fähigkeit!)
* 2.0 stuff:
	* CreepSpotCreep
	* effect functions
	* environment functions
	* group functions

WORKS:
static if (DEBUG_MODE) then
	//! runtextmacro A_STRUCT_DEBUG("\"MyStruct\"")
endif
but deprecated since check is done in macro itself, optional is enough AND macro is declared even if the file isn't imported!

* DONE: test A_DEBUG_NATIVES
* DONE: Drop Zinc debug macros -> no Zinc support
* DEPRECATED: Revise MoveSubString() and MoveString() AND add unit tests.
* DONE: test ResetTerrainFogForPlayer() for desync
* DONE: fix IsUnitInvulnerable()
* DEPRECATED: test AKillQuestItem.
* FIXED: ShowBashTextTagForPlayer() needs proper colors?
* DONE: Fix CreateImageForPlayer()
* DEPRECATED: Revise AIndicator.
* DONE: test ALibraryCoreInterfaceCamera functions for desync
* DONE: Test SetUnitVertexColourForPlayer()
* DONE (works, dropped life and mana extra storage): TEST BONUS MOD FUNCTIONALITY AGAIN: Maybe implement another solution.
* DONE: Fix ARoutine revision.
* DONE: Test ARoutine revision.
* DONE: AMainWindow:
	Should be dynamic members:
	m_useShortcuts
	private boolean m_useSpecialShortcuts
	private integer m_shortcut
* DONE: ARoutine: Maybe hook SetTimeOfDay etc. to get manual time changes and end routine periods?
* DONE: Test new Unit Test framework.
* DONE: Move all tests into new directory "Test"
*	//! runtextmacro A_TEST_RUN("ABonusModTest")
	//! runtextmacro A_TEST_PRINT("ABonusModTest") doesn't print when run the first time
* DONE: Test new string functions/change string test to unit test:
	function StringLeft takes string whichString, integer number returns string
	function StringRight takes string whichString, integer number returns string
	function StringAppend takes string whichString, string other returns string
	function StringPrepend takes string whichString, string other returns string
	function StringRepeated takes string whichString, integer number returns string
	function StringResize takes string whichString, integer size returns string
	function StringTruncate takes string whichString, integer position returns string
	function StringRemoveCharPool takes string whichString, string charPool returns string
	function StringTrim takes string whichString returns string
	function StringTrimLeft takes string whichString returns string
	function StringTrimRight takes string whichString returns string

* Check out WaterKnight's ReviveUnit(): https://warcraft.ingame.de/forum/showthread.php?p=4633706&postcount=29#post4633706
* Another snippet: http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/jass-resources-412/snippet-reviveunit-186696/

2011-11-20 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* DONE: ARoutine: Test revision.

* DONE: Fix new item copy feature of CopyUnit()!
* waitForVideo() seems to be bugged randomly and doesn't end sometimes.

2011-11-18 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* DONE: Report JassHelper bugs which prevent from using option [forcemethodevaluate].

2011-11-06 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
 A_MAP: Should use more efficient storage so that the middle elements could be detected much faster (at the moment they are detected by iterating all elements  - linear complexity). We need a binary tree implementation to store nodes!

2011-11-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* Structures must accept JASS constants as maximum size so we can define maximum count of container instances for A_VECTOR, A_LIST, A_MAP and A_STACK!
* Add global option that default containers should be generated. Otherwise there will only be those one which are used by ASL itself!
* Move ALL tutorial stuff into API documentation which has to be improved massively!!!!

2011-11-04 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* A_MAP: Test new revisions!

2010-07-10 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* FIXED: Items which aren't owned by other players are interpreted as such by rucksack system.

Eine Startaktion (ausgeführt ab Uhrzeit) und eine Schleifenaktion (läuft wenn angekommen), welche TriggerSleepActions enthalten darf, nächste erfolgt erst nach Ablauf über manuellen Aufruf von continue oder so.
* DONE: Außerdem noch eine mögliche Endaktion aufrufen, falls benötigt.
* DONE: Wird der NPC pausiert, so wird sein aktueller Tagesablauf ebenfalls pausiert. Ist er am Zielpunkt bereits angekommen, so wird bei der Depausierung, falls der Tagesablauf in der Zwischenzeit abgelaufen ist

* Note: Do not destroy triggers in their own actions if there are some TriggerSleepAction calls after destruction.

2009-07-18 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* Native declarations in map file don't work.

2009-07-11 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* Maybe we should use function UnitDropItemSlot instead of all those item removals in the inventory system.

2009-07-07 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* Perhaps you should add various characters schema pages/views like statistics (deaths, kills etc.).
* Add button models for system debugger (by using Blender).

2009-06-21 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>

2009-06-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* DEPRECATED: Implement a vector for player characters.
* DONE: Finish function CopyUnit.
* DONE: Finish ATalk and AInfo revision.

2009-05-25 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* FIXED: Revival timer does only appear when the character dies with "Reincarnation".
* Note: Don't make a character unmovable when he dies since this will disable all systems (like revival). Specify everything for each single system!

2009-05-22 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* DONE: We need lists like in C++ for structs like ALightningChain!

2009-05-21 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* FIXED: File "archives/Creatures/Models/Creatures/Undeads/Zombie.mdx" doesn't work?!

2009-05-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* Missing functions SetTerrainFogForPlayer and SetTerrainFogExForPlayer?

2009-04-09 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* FIXED: AInventory: Unit orders for moving items aren't received.
* FIXED: AInventory: Equipment is not placed in rucksack if you've already equipped an item of the same equipment type.
* FIXED: AInventory: Attributes should always be the same (if you open your rucksack).
* FIXED: AInventory: Change rucksack page items aren't usable.
* DONE: ACharacterScheme: Add a separator field between hit points and mana bar.

2009-04-08 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* Add member m_ prefix and rename get methods.
* FIXED: Main window is not created correctly.

2009-04-05 Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* Add log functionality to talk system for AInfo instances.
* DONE: Fix revival timer function call.
* DONE: Fix talk trigger sleep function.
* DONE: Fix name display in character scheme.
* Maybe add preloadMusic() function since music loading often laggs in game.
* DONE: Quest pings should be displayed at the same time (maybe use only one ping trigger for all).

Tamino Dauth <tamino@cdauth.eu>
* FIXED: Abstract quest id won't be attached correctly on its state trigger.
* FIXED: First speech of talks will be displayed but the wait time will be ignored (Executions are right)!
* FIXED: Rucksack page items can not be equipped.
* bj_MAX_PLAYERS an manchen Stellen durch eine Funktion ersetzen, die die maximale Spieleranzahl der jeweiligen Karte zurückgibt.
* FIXED: Test the important talk speech and the normal talk speech (There are several problems with using TriggerSleepActions in action executions).
* FIXED: Videos should be stopped immediatly (stop execution if it is possible).
* Character selection select action should be called (probably it is causing many bugs).
* InsertLineBreaks is bugged! When it is debugged use it in Gui.showInfoDialog()!
* Since there is gexxo's FirstOfGroupSave() function you have to replace all FirstOfGroup() calls which are used on groups which contain units which can be removed during the game.
* DONE: Check size member of AContainer struct.

Notes:
* When you use a talk button, the action of the button won't be runned and it does not wait for finishing the transmission.
* The save bug (Undefined type nothinng) was caused by the fpscommon.j.
* Man muss jedes Mal MultiboardGetItem erneut aufrufen, dann etwas ändern (Es gehen auch mehrere Dinge) und dann MultiboardReleaseItem aufrufen.
* The TriggerSleepAction function does not work in executions. That's the reason for some bugs in ATalk and AVideo.
* Das Video wurde automatisch übersprungen, da die Bedingung dem Auslöser nicht hinzugefügt wurde.
* %s or something similar could crash Warcraft if you placed it in the custom script section.
* Methods are often called by TriggerEvaluate:
Methods are different to normal functions in that they can be called from any place (except global declarations)
and that you are not necessarily able to use waits, sync natives or GetTriggeringTrigger() inside them
(but you may use any other event response), you might be able to use them but it depends on various factors,
it is not recommended to use them at all. In next versions the compiler might even raise a syntax error when
it finds them.
I should probably extend stuff, if you call a method from above its declaration,
it is called with TriggerEvaluate, also if you make a method virtual
(that is, the method comes from an interface or is a stub method)
